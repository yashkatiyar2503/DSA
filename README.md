### What is a Data Structure?
Data Structures are different ways of organizing data on your computer, that can be used effectively.
### What is an Algorithm?
Set of rules for a computer program to accomplish a Task

* Divide and conquer algorithms
  - Divide the problem into smaller subproblems of the same type, and solve these subproblems recursively
  - Combine the solutions to the subproblems into a solution to the original problem
+ Dynamic programming algorithms
- Greedy algorithms
* Brute force algorithms
+ Randomized algorithms
